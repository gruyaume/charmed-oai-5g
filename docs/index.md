**OAI 5G Core** is an open source 5G core network.
The goal of the OAI-5G Core Network (CN) project group is to provide a 3GPP-Compliant 5G 
Standalone (SA) CN implementation with a rich feature set. OAI 5G CN is designed and implemented 
in a flexible way which can be easily adapted to fulfill the needs of diversified 5G use-cases. 
All the features of the OAI 5G CN components are continuously tested with professional testers, 
commercial gNBs (with COTS UE) and open-source RAN simulators.  

This project provides operators to make it easy to deploy and operate a 5G Core Network on 
Kubernetes.
