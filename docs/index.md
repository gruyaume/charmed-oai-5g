**OAI 5G** is an open source 5G core and radio network.
The goal of the OpenAirInterface 5G Core Network project is to provide a 3GPP-Compliant 5G 
Standalone Core Network implementation with a rich feature set. OAI 5G Core Network is designed and implemented 
in a flexible way which can be easily adapted to fulfill the needs of diversified 5G use-cases. 
All the features of the Core components are continuously tested with professional testers, 
commercial gNBs and open-source RAN simulators. You can learn more about OpenAirInterface [here](https://www.openairinterface.org/).

**Charmed OAI 5G** provides operators to make it easy to deploy and operate the OpenAirInterface 
5G Core and the RAN Network on Kubernetes.
